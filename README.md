Project Title: Heart Disease Prediction System

Objective:

Developed a predictive system using machine learning algorithms to classify the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health metrics, leveraging real-world datasets from Kaggle.

Data Preprocessing:

•	Cleaned and prepared raw Kaggle datasets by handling missing values, normalizing numerical data, and encoding categorical variables to ensure model readiness.

•	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas and Matplotlib, identifying trends and correlations in patient health metrics.

Model Development:

•	Built and trained multiple machine learning models, including K-Means, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, to classify heart disease cases.

•	Applied feature selection techniques to identify the most significant predictors, improving model accuracy.

•	Tuned hyperparameters using techniques such as Grid Search and Cross-Validation to optimize performance.

Evaluation and Insights:

•	Compared model performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to determine the best-performing algorithm.

•	Achieved a model accuracy of 92% using Random Forest, surpassing benchmark models for similar datasets.

Insights:

•	Model Optimization: Improved prediction accuracy by fine-tuning hyperparameters and removing noisy data points.

•	Feature Engineering: Demonstrated significance of features such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and age in predicting heart disease.
